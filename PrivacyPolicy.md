Privacy Policy for Local LLM

Last Updated: November 26, 2024

Welcome to Local LLM ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle (or rather, don't handle) your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

1. Introduction

Local LLM is committed to protecting your privacy. Our app is designed with privacy at its core, operating entirely on your device without external data transmission.

2. Information Collection and Use

Local LLM operates differently from typical chat applications:

- All processing occurs locally on your device
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No personal information is collected by us
- All conversations and data remain strictly on your device
- We have no access to your conversations or usage patterns

3. Data Storage

- All data is stored locally on your device
- You maintain complete ownership and control of your data
- Data storage location: Your device's local storage only
- No cloud backup services are provided or required

4. Technical Operation

The app requires the following permissions:
- Storage access (to save your conversations locally)
- Computing resources (to run the language model)
- No internet access is required for core functionality

5. Your Data Rights

As all data remains on your device, you have complete control:
- Access your data at any time
- Delete your data directly from your device
- No need to request data deletion from us (we don't have your data)
- Export your data (if the feature is available in your version)

6. Children's Privacy

Our app does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. As all processing is local, parents have complete oversight over their children's use of the app.

7. Data Security

Security is inherent in our design:
- No data transmission means no data interception risk
- Local storage follows your device's security standards
- We recommend keeping your device secured with a password/biometric lock

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material changes through the app.

9. Crash Reports and Analytics

- We do not collect crash reports
- We do not track analytics
- We do not monitor app usage
- Any diagnostic information stays on your device

10. Contact Information

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the app's privacy practices, please contact us at:

11. Device Backup Notice

Please note that your device's built-in backup systems (like Android backup) might include Local LLM's data directory. Managing these backups is under your control through your device's settings.

12. Open Source Components

Local LLM may use open-source components. These components operate entirely on your device and maintain the same privacy standards as the rest of the application.

13. App Termination

If you choose to uninstall the app:
- All associated data is removed from your device
- No residual data remains on any external servers (as none was ever sent)
- No further action is required to protect your privacy

14. Compliance

This privacy policy complies with:
- Google Play Store requirements
- Privacy laws and regulations
- Local data protection standards

By using Local LLM, you agree to this Privacy Policy. As the app operates entirely on your device, you remain in control of your data at all times.
